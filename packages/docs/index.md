## Why TrenchSniper OS?

Most Solana trading tools are either paid bots with revenue shares, closed-source black boxes, or half-finished scripts on GitHub. TrenchSniper OS is different:

- **Free & Open Source** — MIT licensed, audit the code yourself
- **Self-Hosted** — Runs on your machine, your keys never leave your browser
- **Multi-DEX** — Jupiter, PumpFun (PumpPortal API), with Raydium and Meteora coming
- **Real Dashboard** — Not a CLI script — a full React UI with real-time state
- **Battle-Tested** — Every feature makes real trades on mainnet

```bash
git clone https://github.com/natebag/Trenchtools.git
cd Trenchtools
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
